# Project name: Manager Spel

## Description
A basic manager simulation game by C#  
The project was done by using Visual Studio 2019  

## Background and idea
This simple C# game is the project I did as a graduation project in a course called ``Programmering 2`` in high school, where we learned ``object-oriented programming with C#`` at the beginner level.  
The task given to the students by the course examiner was to make a simulation game using the C# language that runs on the ``terminal`` without graphics and application.  
This simulation game had to be a manager game and had to have a football league with several teams, match simulations, match tactics, buying and selling players. Everyone had to work alone for the project. Using other people's code and any library importing was not allowed.  
This project got a ``grade B`` with the F-A grading system.
